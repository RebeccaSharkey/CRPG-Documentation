!!! warning

	Work in progress.

### **10.1. Interconnected Map**

The game world is a vast and interconnected realm, with the **Lord Ruler’s domain** at the center. Players are free to explore in a non-linear fashion, moving between different regions known as **courts**, each associated with one of the playable classes. The map is not constrained by a ring layout, but rather by natural, geographic, and magical borders that give each court its unique characteristics and challenges.

- **Court Layout**: Each court is thematically tied to a playable class, and its design reflects the class’s traits, culture, and aesthetics. For example:
    - **The Elemental Court** (associated with the **Elemental Channeler**) is dominated by dynamic natural forces, with raging storms, volcanic landscapes, and tranquil oceans.
    - **The Echo Court** (associated with the **Echo Weaver**) is a vibrant realm of music and art, where sound, color, and creativity shape the environment.
    - **The Technomancer’s Court** is a fusion of advanced magical technology and mechanical constructs, filled with intricate machinery and towering magical devices.
- **Non-Linear Exploration**: Players can explore the courts in any order, but the corruption mechanic will influence the difficulty of each region. Courts that are left unchecked for too long will become more corrupted, increasing enemy strength and locking out certain quests or opportunities.

### **10.2. Court Design and Features**

Each court serves as a hub for specific gameplay elements, such as quests, class progression, and world-building. Liberating a court will unlock unique class abilities, spells, and upgrades, as well as unraveling the lore tied to that court.

- **Unique Court Environments**: Courts are visually distinct, showcasing different biomes and architectural styles that reflect the class they represent. From wild forests and sacred totems in the **Beastmaster’s Court**, to the otherworldly dimension-bending landscapes of the **Dimensional Reaver’s Court**, the world will be full of variety and intrigue.
    
- **Corruption and World Progression**: Corruption spreads across the realm as the Lord Ruler’s influence grows. This mechanic will affect each court, causing its landscape, enemies, and quests to become more challenging over time. Players must balance exploration and court liberation to prevent the world from becoming overrun by corruption.
    

### **10.3. Exploration and Player Freedom**

Exploration plays a key role in the game’s design, with players able to uncover hidden secrets, lore, and treasures by venturing into the deepest corners of each court. Players will need to manage their time and resources wisely, balancing exploration, combat, and resting to counter the spread of corruption.

- **Dynamic World Events**: As players explore, they will encounter dynamic world events—such as corrupted beasts attacking towns, magical anomalies in the environment, or court-specific challenges—that change based on the current corruption level. These events offer opportunities for valuable rewards or to slow down the spread of corruption.
    
- **Fast Travel and Movement**: Players will have access to fast travel between liberated courts, but early on, they will need to traverse the world on foot, using mounts or spells to cover greater distances. Special pathways, magical portals, or hidden shortcuts can also be discovered as players explore.
    

### **10.4. Environmental Interactivity**

The world of the game is rich with interactive elements. Players can interact with various objects in the environment, solve puzzles, and manipulate their surroundings to gain an advantage in combat or exploration.

- **Environmental Puzzles**: Some courts will feature puzzles or challenges that players must solve to unlock secrets or progress in quests. These puzzles will often be tied to the court’s theme (e.g., using elemental powers in the **Elemental Court** or manipulating sound in the **Echo Court**).
    
- **Hidden Areas and Secrets**: The game world is full of hidden areas, treasures, and lore entries that players can discover through exploration. Some secrets will only be accessible after liberating certain courts or unlocking specific abilities tied to those courts.
