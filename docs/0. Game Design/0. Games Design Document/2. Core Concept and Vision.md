	Work in progress.

### **2.1 Game Overview**

This game is a **tactical, turn-based RPG** set in a high fantasy world where the balance of power has been disrupted by the **Lord Ruler**, a powerful demon who has conquered the realm and eradicated magic to make demons unkillable. The player takes on the role of a character with ties to nobility, who starts the game imprisoned in a parallel realm. The player must free themselves, gather allies, and liberate the courts—each tied to one of the game's unique playable classes—from the Lord Ruler’s corruption.

The story, gameplay, and setting are deeply interconnected, offering a blend of high fantasy, dark themes, and imaginative, fantastical elements. The game places a strong emphasis on **player choice** and **non-linear progression**, allowing the player to decide which courts to tackle first. However, corruption spreads over time, raising the stakes and making unliberated courts increasingly difficult to clear.

### **2.2 Key Features**

- **Turn-Based Tactical Combat**: Combat is grid-based and turn-based, with a focus on tactical positioning, resource management (AP and MP), and class synergy. Each class has distinct abilities that can be combined for devastating effects in combat.
    
- **Class Skill Trees**: The game offers 8 unique classes, each with 5 subclass branches. Players can customize their characters by investing in any of the branches, blending class abilities to create hybrid builds. The subclasses represent typical archetypes like tank, healer, support, close DPS, and ranged DPS, but with fantastical and imaginative twists.
    
- **Court-Based Exploration**: The world is divided into courts, each representing one of the playable classes. Players must liberate the courts to gain access to class-specific abilities and lore, while also unlocking powerful spells tied to the court they are freeing. The map is interconnected, allowing players to choose their own path toward the Lord Ruler.
    
- **Dynamic Corruption Mechanic**: As players progress, corruption spreads throughout the realm, making enemies tougher and courts harder to liberate. Resting also impacts the corruption mechanic, forcing players to balance their resource recovery with the growing corruption threat.
    
- **Multiple Endings**: The player’s choices throughout the game, including which courts to liberate and how they handle the spread of corruption, will lead to multiple endings. These endings range from total victory over the Lord Ruler to more bittersweet or tragic outcomes if the corruption becomes too widespread.
    
- **Companions and Party System**: Players can recruit a variety of companions from different courts, each with their own backstories and unique abilities. The party system allows for up to 4 characters, with class synergies being key to success in combat.
    

### **2.3 Narrative Themes**

- **The Struggle Against Corruption**: The game’s primary narrative focuses on liberating the world from the corruption spread by the Lord Ruler. As the player explores the courts and uncovers the truth behind the realm’s downfall, they will discover deep, dark secrets about the nobility and the Lord Ruler’s origins as a demon from a parallel realm.
    
- **Player Freedom and Responsibility**: The player is given the freedom to choose how they approach each court, but their decisions have long-lasting consequences. Every rest taken, every court liberated or left unchecked, and every ally gained or lost will influence the game’s outcome.
    
- **Fantasy and Imagination**: The world is rich with fantastical elements, blending high fantasy with imaginative class designs, magical creatures, and surreal settings. From the **Elemental Channeler’s mastery of primal forces** to the **Echo Weaver’s manipulation of sound and art**, the game leans into creativity and the unexpected.
    

### **2.4 Gameplay Loop**

The core gameplay loop involves:

1. **Exploration**: Players travel between courts, exploring unique environments, engaging in quests, and uncovering lore.
    
2. **Combat**: Engaging in tactical, turn-based combat where players can combine abilities, manage resources, and utilize their environment to gain the upper hand.
    
3. **Resting and Corruption Management**: Players must decide when to rest to recover AP, MP, and HP. Resting accelerates the spread of corruption, making decisions about timing crucial.
    
4. **Quest Completion and Court Liberation**: Each court offers quests related to its culture, class, and the overarching narrative. Liberating courts rewards the player with powerful class-specific abilities and slows the spread of corruption.
    

### **2.5 Aesthetic and Tone**

- **Art Style**: The game’s art direction will blend high fantasy with a slightly dark, surreal aesthetic. Courts will be distinct in their visual design, reflecting the nature of the class they represent. For example, the **Fatespinner’s court** will be mysterious, with dreamlike visuals, while the **Technomancer’s court** will feature advanced, magical technology.
    
- **Tone**: While the game features dark and serious themes (such as corruption and the fall of nobility), it will also emphasize fantasy, creativity, and wonder. The world is meant to feel vast, magical, and full of possibilities, even as the corruption threatens to engulf it.
