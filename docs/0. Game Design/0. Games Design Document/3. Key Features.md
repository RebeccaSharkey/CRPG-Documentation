	Work in progress.

### **3.1. Turn-Based Combat System:**
Tactical, d20-based combat with initiative, movement, and action points.

### **3.2. Court Liberation Mechanic:**
Liberate courts one by one, breaking their curses and unlocking unique spells and abilities tied to the courtâ€™s culture and aesthetics.

### **3.3. Dynamic Corruption Mechanic:**
As the player progresses, corruption spreads to other courts. The longer the player takes, the more difficult and corrupt the courts become.

### **3.4. Character Creation:** 
Players customize their character using a point-buy stat system and can choose from 7 classes, each with 5 unique subclasses each, allowing for deep customization and varied playstyles.

### **3.5. Multiple Endings:**
Player choices will drastically affect the outcome of the game, with multiple possible endings based on which courts were liberated, the player's alliances, and whether the true nature of the Lord Ruler was revealed.

### **3.6. Rest System:**
Players must balance resting with progress, as resting advances the day-night cycle and spreads corruption, increasing the challenge in remaining courts.

### **3.7. Primal Worship System:** 
Players choose a Primal (deity-like figure) to worship, which grants them unique boons and abilities. Different NPCs also follow Primals, impacting interactions and quest outcomes.
