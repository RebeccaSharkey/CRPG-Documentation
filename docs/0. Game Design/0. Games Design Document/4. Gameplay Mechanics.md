	Work in progress.

### **4.1. Stat System**

The game’s stat system governs core attributes that influence a character’s abilities and interactions. The stats are:

- **Vitality (VIT):** Governs HP, Stamina, and Physical resilience.
- **Agility (AGI):** Governs movement Speed, Initiative, precision-based attacks and dodge chance.
- **Power (PWR):** Governs physical attack damage and carrying capacity.
- **Arcana (ARC):** Governs magic power and the size of the Mana Pool (MP).
- **Wisdom (WIS):** Governs mental acuity, perception, and MP regeneration.
- **Resilience (RES):** Governs defences against status effects, environmental hazards, and long-term damage.

### **4.2. Action Points (AP) and Mana Points (MP)**

#### **AP (Action Points) System**:

- **Max AP Pool**: Determined by the **Vitality modifier * 3**.
    - Example: If a player has **16 Vitality (+3 modifier)**, their **Max AP Pool** would be **3 * 3 = 9 AP**.
- **AP Regeneration**: Determined by the formula:
    - **AP Regeneration = (Agility modifier * 2) + Vitality modifier**
    - Example: If a player has **16 Vitality (+3 modifier)** and **14 Agility (+2 modifier)**, their AP regeneration would be **(2 * 2) + 3 = 7 AP per turn**.
- **Cap on Regeneration**: The **AP regeneration per turn** cannot exceed the player's **Max AP Pool**, determined by their Vitality modifier.
    - Example: If a player’s **Max AP** is **9 AP**, their AP regeneration cannot go higher than **9 AP** per turn, even if modifiers suggest more.
- **Minimum AP Regeneration**: Players always regenerate at least **2 AP per turn**, even if diminishing returns affect their regeneration rate.

#### **MP (Mana Points) System**:

- **Max MP Pool**: Determined by the **Arcana modifier * 3**.
    - Example: If a player has **14 Arcana (+2 modifier)**, their **Max MP Pool** would be **2 * 3 = 6 MP**.
- **MP Regeneration**: Determined by the formula:
    - **MP Regeneration = (Wisdom modifier * 2) + Arcana modifier**
    - Example: If a player has **16 Wisdom (+3 modifier)** and **14 Arcana (+2 modifier)**, their MP regeneration would be **(3 * 2) + 2 = 8 MP per turn**.
- **Cap on Regeneration**: The **MP regeneration per turn** cannot exceed the player's **Max MP Pool**, determined by their Arcana modifier.
    - Example: If a player’s **Max MP** is **6 MP**, their MP regeneration cannot exceed **6 MP** per turn.
- **Minimum MP Regeneration**: Players always regenerate at least **2 MP per turn**, even if diminishing returns affect their regeneration rate.

### **4.3. Combat System Overview**

- **Turn-Based Combat:** Combat will follow an initiative-based system where players and enemies take turns performing actions based on their **initiative order**, governed by **Agility**.
- **Action Economy:** Players use **AP** to perform actions like moving, attacking, or casting spells, which regenerates each turn based on **Agility** and **Vitality**. Spellcasting or Magical Abilities also requires **MP**, which regenerates each turn based on **Arcana** and **Wisdom**.
- **Court-Specific Abilities:** Each court has its own unique set of spells and abilities that the player can unlock after liberating the court. Players from a particular court gain enhanced versions of those abilities.

---

### **4.4. Rest and Corruption System Overview**

#### **Full Rest**:

- **Effect**: Fully restores the player's **HP, AP, and MP pools** and resets the diminishing returns for **AP and MP regeneration** to their initial values.
- **Corruption Impact**: Taking a full rest significantly advances corruption in the courts, making enemies stronger and possibly locking off certain quests.

#### **Half Rest**:

- **Effect**:
    - A **half rest** adds the player's **Vitality modifier** to their **AP regeneration** and their **Arcana modifier** to their **MP regeneration**. This increase is permanent until the next rest, and the regeneration rate will continue with the new increased values.
    - The regeneration boost from a half rest still respects the **Max Pool** cap for both **AP and MP**.
- **Corruption Impact**: Half rests cause a moderate amount of corruption spread, but less than full rests.

### **4.5. Dialogue and Interaction Mechanics**

The game will feature various forms of interactions outside of combat, including **persuasion checks**, **knowledge checks**, and **perception-based actions** that impact the way the player navigates the world and interacts with NPCs and objects. Below are the main types of interaction mechanics:

#### **4.5.1. Persuasion Checks**

Persuasion checks allow players to influence NPCs during conversations. These checks open up additional dialogue options, help avoid conflict, and unlock quests or items that wouldn’t be available otherwise.

- **Types of Persuasion**:
    - **Diplomatic Persuasion**: Based on **Wisdom**. Used for calm reasoning, negotiating, or understanding the motivations of others.
    - **Intimidation**: Based on **Power**. Used to coerce or threaten NPCs into submission.
    - **Arcane Persuasion**: Based on **Arcana**. Used when dealing with magical creatures, sentient constructs, or ancient beings familiar with magic.

#### **4.5.2. Knowledge Checks**

Knowledge checks give players the ability to unlock hidden lore, decipher texts, and understand magical items or symbols. These checks often provide players with key information needed to progress through quests or access special abilities.

- **Arcana Checks**: Based on **Arcana**. Used to understand and interact with magical items, ancient arcane symbols, and enchanted locations.
- **Wisdom Checks**: Based on **Wisdom**. Used to comprehend historical events, navigate complex social structures, or analyze strategic environments.

#### **4.5.3. Perception and Insight Checks**

**Perception** and **Insight** checks determine a player’s ability to notice details in the environment, uncover hidden information, and detect lies or intent during dialogue.

- **Perception**: Based on **Wisdom** and **Agility**. This check allows the player to find hidden traps, objects, or paths in the environment, as well as identify subtle environmental changes that can affect gameplay.
    
    - **Buffs**: Higher **Wisdom** improves a player's awareness of magical or arcane elements in the environment, while **Agility** enhances the player’s ability to react quickly to physical changes, such as noticing traps or enemies in stealth.
- **Insight**: Based on **Wisdom**. Insight checks allow the player to detect lies or hidden motives during dialogue, as well as gain deeper understanding of NPC emotions and intentions.
    
    - **Buffs**: A higher **Wisdom** score increases the chance of accurately reading characters, uncovering deception, and unlocking hidden dialogue options.

#### **4.5.4. Investigation**

Investigation checks are used when the player needs to closely examine an object or area. Unlike **Perception**, which focuses on noticing hidden things at a glance, **Investigation** requires the player to dig deeper, analyze, and piece together clues.

- **Investigation**: Based on **Wisdom** and **Arcana**. This allows the player to thoroughly analyze objects, structures, or magical wards, piecing together clues that might otherwise go unnoticed. Investigation often plays a key role in solving puzzles or unraveling mysteries.
    - **Buffs**: High **Wisdom** allows better insight into objects or symbols with historical relevance, while **Arcana** enhances the player’s ability to understand magical or enchanted items.

#### **4.5.5. Survival and Tracking**

Survival and tracking checks allow the player to navigate dangerous terrain, find resources in the wild, or follow tracks left by enemies or animals.

- **Survival**: Based on **Vitality** and **Wisdom**. This governs the player's ability to find food, water, or shelter, as well as their ability to endure environmental hazards.
    - **Buffs**: Higher **Vitality** improves stamina and resilience in harsh environments, while **Wisdom** increases a player's ability to navigate natural environments and make strategic decisions.
- **Tracking**: Based on **Wisdom** and **Agility**. Used to follow the footprints of enemies, animals, or even magical creatures through forests, deserts, or urban settings.
    - **Buffs**: Higher **Wisdom** allows players to read terrain and notice subtle signs of movement, while **Agility** improves speed and precision when pursuing targets.

### **4.6. Types of Interaction Mechanics**

Interaction mechanics are categorized into the following types, each of which is influenced by the player’s stats:

#### **4.6.1. Conversational Interactions**

These are primarily dialogue-based and rely on persuasion and insight mechanics to influence NPCs, uncover hidden dialogue options, or avoid unnecessary combat.

- **Stat Focus**: **Wisdom**, **Power**, **Arcana**
    - **Persuasion** (Diplomatic, Intimidation, Arcane)
    - **Insight** (to detect lies, hidden motives, or NPC emotions)

#### **4.6.2. Environmental Interactions**

Environmental interactions allow the player to notice, analyse, or react to details in the environment. These mechanics include perception checks to find traps or hidden objects, as well as investigation checks for more thorough analysis.

- **Stat Focus**: **Wisdom**, **Agility**, **Arcana**
    - **Perception** (finding hidden objects, traps, or environmental changes)
    - **Investigation** (analysing objects, discovering clues, understanding arcane or magical effects)

#### **4.6.3. Knowledge-Based Interactions**

These interactions involve the player’s ability to understand historical events, lore, or magical phenomena. Knowledge checks are crucial for deciphering ancient texts, unlocking powerful relics, or interacting with magical artifacts.

- **Stat Focus**: **Wisdom**, **Arcana**
    - **Arcana Checks** (understanding magic-related elements)
    - **Wisdom Checks** (analysing historical or cultural information)

#### **4.6.4. Survival-Based Interactions**

These interactions are critical when the player is navigating difficult terrains, searching for resources, or tracking enemies and animals. They allow the player to survive in harsh environments and gain advantages when exploring the wilderness.

- **Stat Focus**: **Vitality**, **Wisdom**, **Agility**
    - **Survival** (finding food, shelter, resources)
    - **Tracking** (following footprints, reading signs of movement)

### **4.8 Ability Tree System and Progression**

Each class has a **non-linear ability tree** divided into multiple branches. These branches represent the subclass archetypes such as **Tank, Healer, Support, Close DPS, and Ranged DPS**. The tree grows outward as players invest **Ability Points (AP)**, and players can freely switch between branches to create **hybrid builds** or specialize in a single role.

#### **4.8.1 Active Abilities and Buffs**

- **Active Abilities**: Spells, skills, or attacks that players can equip and use in combat. Players unlock more active abilities as they level up, with the number of active abilities increasing over time.
- **Buffs (Passives)**: Permanent bonuses that improve stats, reduce cooldowns, or increase ability effectiveness. Buffs are unlocked similarly to active abilities and can be used to strengthen a player’s build.

#### **4.8.2 Ability Point Investment**

- Players gain **1 Ability Point (AP)** per level, which can be used to unlock either **active abilities** or **buffs** within the tree.
- Players can choose to invest in one subclass or branch into others.
    - **4 AP in Tier 1** unlocks **Tier 2**.
    - **5 AP in Tier 2** unlocks **Tier 3**.
    - **5 AP in Tier 3** unlocks **Tier 4**.
    - **5 AP in Tier 4** unlocks **Tier 5** (ultimate ability).

#### **4.8.3 Hybrid Builds**

Players are not locked into one branch and can freely mix and match abilities from different branches. It would take **20AP** to unlock the ultimate ability in one subclass, the remaining **5AP** can be used to invest in other subclasses, allowing for hybrid builds.

---

### **4.9 Levelling and Progression**

Players can level up to **Level 25**. As they progress, they gain **Ability Points (AP)** and **Stat Points** to unlock new abilities, buffs, or increase core stats.
