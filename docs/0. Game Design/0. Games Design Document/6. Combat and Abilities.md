### **6.1. Combat Overview**

The combat system will be turn-based, using a tactical, grid-based format. Each unit on the battlefield (players and enemies) has a set number of **Action Points (AP)** and **Mana Points (MP)** to spend per turn. Players will be able to move, use abilities, or interact with the environment based on how they choose to spend their AP and MP. Combat will rely heavily on positioning, resource management, and synergizing abilities between party members.

- **Initiative System**: Combat turns will be ordered by initiative, which is determined at the start of each encounter by factors like **Agility**, **Luck**, or **class-specific abilities**.
- **Action Points (AP)**: Used for movement, physical attacks, and non-magical abilities. The amount of AP regenerates each turn based on the player’s stats (e.g., **Vitality** and **Agility**).
- **Mana Points (MP)**: Used to cast spells and magical abilities. MP regenerates per turn based on **Arcana** and **Wisdom** stats.

### **6.2. Resource Management**

- **AP System**:
    - The max AP pool is determined by the **Vitality modifier * 3**.
    - Regeneration is based on a combination of **Agility** and **Vitality modifiers**, with diminishing returns after prolonged combat. The minimum regeneration per turn is 2, and the maximum regeneration is capped by the character’s maximum AP pool.
- **MP System**:
    - The max MP pool is determined by the **Arcana modifier * 3**.
    - Regeneration is governed by **Wisdom** and **Arcana modifiers**, following the same diminishing returns system as AP. MP regeneration per turn also has a minimum of 2 and a cap based on the maximum MP pool.

### **6.3. Rest System**

Resting is integral to the game’s pacing and strategy. Players will need to rest to recover resources (AP, MP, HP), but each rest will also have consequences in terms of corruption spread throughout the world.

- **Full Rest**:
    - Fully restores HP, AP, and MP, and resets diminishing returns.
    - Advances corruption significantly, making enemies tougher and courts more difficult to liberate.
- **Half Rest**:
    - Restores 50% of HP, AP, and MP.
    - Permanently increases AP regeneration by the **Vitality modifier** and MP regeneration by the **Arcana modifier**. This increase is subject to the regeneration cap.
    - Causes a moderate spread of corruption, allowing the player to maintain their current strength without the full risk of a full rest.

### **6.4. Status Effects**

Status effects will play a major role in both player and enemy tactics. These can be buffs (positive effects) or debuffs (negative effects) that last for varying durations.

- **Buffs**: Effects that enhance a character’s abilities, such as increased attack, defence, healing, or resistance. Examples include:
    - **Haste**: Increases movement and AP regeneration.
    - **Fortify**: Increases defence and resistance to damage.
    - **Rejuvenation**: Heals a certain amount of HP per turn.
- **Debuffs**: Negative effects that weaken a character, hinder their abilities, or cause damage over time. Examples include:
    - **Burning**: Causes fire damage each turn.
    - **Poison**: Deals damage over time and reduces healing effectiveness.
    - **Weaken**: Reduces a character’s attack and defence for a set duration.
