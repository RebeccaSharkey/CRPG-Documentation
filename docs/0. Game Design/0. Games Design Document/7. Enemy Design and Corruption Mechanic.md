### **7.1. Enemy Variety**

Enemies will vary based on the court they belong to and the degree of corruption theyâ€™ve suffered. Each court will have its own unique enemy types, inspired by the aesthetics and species from that region. Over time, these enemies will grow stronger as the corruption spreads.

- **Corrupted Beasts**: As corruption spreads, creatures in the wild become twisted versions of themselves, more aggressive and resilient to damage.
- **Court Guardians**: Each court will have powerful mini-bosses or elite units that defend the corruption.
- **Final Boss**: The **Lord Ruler**, a demon from a parallel realm, serves as the overarching antagonist. He seeks to conquer the realm while suppressing magic to make demons unkillable.

### **7.2. Corruption Mechanic**

Corruption spreads throughout the courts in response to player actions (or inaction). The longer a court is left unchecked, the more corruption takes hold, increasing enemy difficulty and potentially locking off quests or storylines.

- **Corruption Progression**: Each court has a **corruption meter** that fills over time, accelerating based on the number of rests or quests ignored.
- **Court Liberation**: Liberating a court breaks the corruption's hold, unlocking new abilities and spells specific to that court.
- **Court-Specific Spells and Abilities**: Once a court is liberated, players unlock court-specific spells and abilities. If the player is originally from that court, these abilities will be stronger.
