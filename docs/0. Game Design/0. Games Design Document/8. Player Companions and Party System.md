!!! warning

	Work in progress.

### **8.1. Companions**

The player will be able to recruit various companions from different courts, each with their own backstories, abilities, and special relationships to the courts they hail from. These companions offer distinct abilities based on their class, and some may have unique skills tied to the lore of their home court. Each companion also has personal quests that explore their background and personal motivations.

- **Companion Classes**: Each companion belongs to one of the playable classes and brings their class abilities into the party. Some companions will be tied to the court associated with their class, while others may have a history of conflict or exile from their homeland.
    
- **Companion Relationships**: Player choices, actions, and dialogue can affect relationships with companions. These relationships can unlock bonuses, special skills, or even new storylines for the companion.

### **8.2. Party Composition**

The party system allows for up to **4 characters**, including the player character. Each party member has their own skill trees, and players are encouraged to experiment with different combinations of classes to create synergies.

- **Class Synergies**: The combination of different classes in the party will play a crucial role in combat strategy. For example, a **Pictomancer** (Echo Weaver tank) could protect a **Skyhunter** (Beastmaster ranged DPS), while a **Vampiric Healer** (Bloodshaper) drains life from enemies to heal the party.
    
- **Flexible Roles**: Players can adjust their partyâ€™s role composition depending on the situation. For instance, switching between offensive, defensive, and support-oriented characters will be key to adapting to the corruption spread in different courts.

### **8.3. Party Tactics**

Players will have the ability to control each character in the party, issuing commands or letting them act according to preset tactics. Each party member will have their own pool of **AP** and **MP** to manage during battle.

- **Tactical Combat**: Players can position their party members on the battlefield for optimal coverage. Frontline tanks like **Dimensional Bastion** or **Beast Rider** can hold the line, while ranged units like **Void Sniper** or **Destiny Archer** can deal damage from a distance.
    
- **Companion Abilities**: Each companion brings a specific set of abilities to the party based on their class and specialization, providing healing, buffs, crowd control, or damage output. Players can switch between manual control and AI-driven tactics for party members.
