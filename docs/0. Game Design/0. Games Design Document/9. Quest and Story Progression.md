### **9.1. Overarching Story**

The world is structured with **courts** surrounding the **Lord Ruler’s domain** at the centre of the realm. Each court represents one of the playable classes, and players will gradually liberate these courts from the growing corruption. The courts are interconnected, and the player can move freely between them, allowing access to class-specific content without being locked out based on their current class choice. As time passes, corruption spreads, making it harder to clear courts that are not yet liberated.

- **Interconnected Map**: The map is structured in concentric rings, with courts surrounding the **Lord Ruler’s central domain**. Players can navigate freely between courts, choosing the order in which they tackle them. Courts not yet liberated become more corrupted over time, increasing enemy difficulty and adding urgency to the player's decisions.
    
- **Class-Based Courts**: Each court represents a specific playable class, tied to its lore, culture, and aesthetics. Liberating a court grants access to class-specific abilities and spells. Players will still have access to these courts even if they are playing the class from that region, ensuring they can experience all aspects of the world.
    
- **Player’s Origin**: The player begins in a prison located in a parallel realm, where they were banished by the Lord Ruler for their ties to nobility. The story will reveal that certain families were kidnapped and hidden, with deep secrets about the true rulers of the realm. It will become apparent that the player was the High Prince(ss), whom was the protector of all the courts in the realm.

### **9.2. Quest Structure**

- **Main Quests**: Central to the progression of the story, focusing on freeing the courts and defeating the Lord Ruler. Main quests advance the plot and unlock new regions on the map.
- **Court Quests**: Each court has its own storyline, reflecting the traits and values of the playable class associated with it. For example, a court tied to the **Elemental Channeler** might focus on mastering primal forces and balancing natural elements, while a court tied to the **Technomancer** could revolve around technological revolutions.
- **Side Quests**: Optional but enriching quests that offer insight into the world, the people, and the backstories of your companions. These quests often provide valuable rewards and lore.

### **9.3. Multiple Endings**

The player’s choices will determine how much of the realm they successfully liberate and how much corruption spreads. The number of courts successfully liberated, the allies gained, and the overall corruption level will affect the ending, with different outcomes ranging from total victory to a partial victory or total failure if corruption overwhelms the realm.
