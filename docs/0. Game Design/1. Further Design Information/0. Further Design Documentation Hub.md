## Sections

### 1. Expanded Gameplay Mechanics
This section delves deeper into the **gameplay mechanics** that build on the core concepts outlined in the GDD. It explores advanced systems that offer players greater interaction, customization, and strategy.

- **Fog of War System**: How unexplored areas of the map remain hidden until the player progresses, and the strategic implications of uncovering hidden regions.
- **Resting and Time Progression**: A dynamic rest system that influences how the player regains action points (AP) and mana points (MP), and how it correlates to the spread of corruption across the game world.
- **Dynamic Weather and Environmental Effects**: The influence of environmental effects on gameplay, including weather conditions that affect movement, combat, and visibility.

### 2. Character and Class Development
This section explores the detailed design of character progression, classes, and how players can customize their characters beyond typical RPG mechanics.

- **Class Trees and Specialization**: A deeper look at the **skill trees** for each class, including how players can spec into multiple subclasses and unlock unique abilities.
- **Hybrid Classes**: How players can mix and match abilities from different classes to create hybrid characters with versatile skill sets.
- **Class-Specific Mechanics**: Detailed information on how each class handles specific gameplay elements, such as summoning, healing, or crafting.

### 3. World-Building and Story Integration
The game's world is rich with lore, history, and complex political dynamics. This section covers the **world-building** process and how it integrates into the player's journey.

- **Courts and Regions**: Each **Court** in the game represents a different cultural and visual theme. Learn how these courts differ in terms of aesthetics, gameplay mechanics, and lore.
- **Factions and Political Dynamics**: Explore the various factions that control the courts and how the player's decisions impact alliances, power dynamics, and the overall progression of the story.
- **Environmental Storytelling**: How world-building and environmental design communicate the game's narrative without direct exposition.

### 4. Visual and Art Design
This section focuses on the visual direction of the game, from character design to environmental aesthetics, and how art design enhances the player’s immersion.

- **Aesthetic Themes by Region**: Each region has its own **visual theme** based on the court it belongs to. Discover the art choices for areas like the fiery landscapes of the Inferno Court or the icy domains of the Frost Court.
- **Character and Creature Design**: The creative process behind designing unique characters, species, and enemies for each court. Includes design notes on how visual elements reinforce gameplay mechanics (e.g., enemies that visually reflect their elemental power).
- **Concept Art**: Early concept art and visual references that helped shape the final design of the game's world and characters.
