# Engine Workflows Hub

Welcome to the **Engine Workflows Hub**, your resource for all Unreal Engine 5 workflows and tools used in the game’s development. This hub covers the development pipelines, level design methodologies, asset management strategies, and custom workflows implemented to streamline the production process.

Explore the sections below to dive into the engine processes that power the game’s world, systems, and mechanics.

---

## Sections

### 1. Level Design and World Creation
This section explains the workflows used to design and populate the game world. Learn how the levels are constructed, streamed, and managed to maintain both performance and player immersion.

- **World Partition**: How Unreal Engine’s **World Partition** system is used to create large, seamless maps with efficient loading and memory management.
- **Level Streaming**: Techniques for streaming in level sections based on player proximity to reduce load times and improve performance.
- **Environment Design**: A step-by-step look at how environments are crafted, from terrain sculpting to lighting and environmental effects.

---

### 2. Asset Management
Managing assets efficiently is critical for any large project. This section outlines the best practices for **asset management**, including file organization, version control, and texture optimization.

- **Naming Conventions and Organization**: How assets are named and structured to ensure consistency across the project.
- **Version Control**: How we use version control systems like **Git** or **Perforce** to manage multiple contributors and track changes.
- **LOD and Texture Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing assets using **Level of Detail (LOD)** systems and texture compression to ensure performance remains smooth.

### 3. Blueprints and C++ Integration
While the game is built primarily in C++, **Blueprints** are used extensively for rapid prototyping and quick iteration. This section covers how **Blueprints** and **C++** are integrated for maximum flexibility and performance.

- **Blueprint for Prototyping**: How Blueprints are used for rapid iteration during the prototyping phase before transitioning into more efficient C++ code.
- **C++ for Core Systems**: Core gameplay mechanics, such as movement, combat, and abilities, are written in C++ to ensure performance.
- **Blueprint/C++ Hybrid**: How some systems, like user interfaces or visual effects, use a hybrid approach of both Blueprint scripting and C++ backend.

### 4. Automation and Tools
To speed up development, custom tools and automation pipelines have been implemented. This section details how tools are built and utilized to streamline workflows and reduce manual labor.

- **Editor Extensions**: Custom editor tools that have been created to simplify level design, asset placement, or repetitive tasks.
- **Automation Pipelines**: Automated systems for testing, building, and packaging the game to ensure stability across different builds and platforms.
- **Performance Profiling**: Tools used to profile the game for performance, allowing us to identify and resolve bottlenecks during development.

---

### 5. Engine Optimization
Ensuring that the game runs smoothly across a variety of hardware configurations is a key concern. This section dives into the optimization workflows used throughout development.

- **Performance Targets**: Targeting stable frame rates and smooth gameplay on both high-end and mid-range systems.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient use of memory to handle large environments, assets, and complex gameplay mechanics.
- **GPU and CPU Profiling**: Profiling tools used to analyze GPU and CPU usage, and how we address performance bottlenecks.

---

### 6. Custom Tools and Pipelines
This section covers the custom tools and pipelines built specifically for the game, designed to increase efficiency and improve development workflows.

- **Custom Blueprint Nodes**: Custom nodes developed in C++ to extend Blueprint functionality, allowing for more flexible and powerful game logic.
- **Asset Import Pipelines**: Tools that streamline the process of importing and preparing assets for the game, from 3D models to textures and animations.
- **Procedural Content Generation**: How procedural generation tools are used to create dynamic environments and world elements.

---

### 7. Multiplayer and Networked Systems
While the game is primarily single-player, future expansions into multiplayer are considered. This section outlines how networked systems are being implemented in preparation for potential multiplayer features.

- **Replication**: How player actions, abilities, and movement are replicated across clients in a networked environment.
- **Server Architecture**: Initial plans for server-client architecture to handle multiplayer game modes.
- **Multiplayer Testing**: How multiplayer systems are tested and optimized for lag-free performance and player synchronization.

## Conclusion
The **Engine Workflows Hub** serves as a comprehensive guide to the engine processes that power the game’s development. From level design to asset management, optimization to automation, this hub is designed to provide insights into the tools and strategies used to build the game efficiently in Unreal Engine 5.
