Why is index broke??

# Game Documentation Hub

Welcome to the **Game Documentation Hub**, your central resource for all information related to the development of the game. This hub includes detailed breakdowns of the game's design, mechanics, codebase, and workflows in Unreal Engine 5.

Explore the sections below to understand the core design principles, technical implementation, and development strategies behind the project.

## Game Design Document (GDD)

The **Game Design Document (GDD)** lays the foundation for the entire project. It provides an in-depth look at the core concept, mechanics, story, and systems that make up the game. This includes:

- **Core Concept**: The game’s world, its central conflict, and the high-fantasy elements that drive its narrative.
- **Story and Setting**: The overarching plot, from the mysterious Lord Ruler who has eradicated magic, to the various courts and regions under his control.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: The game’s turn-based combat system, featuring d20 rolls, initiative orders, movement, and attacks.
- **Classes and Abilities**: An extensive system of classes and subclasses that allow players to build unique characters, each with a progression tree leading to powerful abilities.
- **Progression System**: How players level up, unlock abilities, and progress through the game world.

The GDD is the go-to document for understanding the vision and design direction of the project.

## Further Design Information

The **Further Design Information** section goes beyond the initial design and explores additional features, evolving mechanics, and aesthetic decisions. This includes:

- **Advanced Gameplay Mechanics**: Mechanics like fog of war, ambush triggers, and dynamic events that enhance tactical gameplay.
- **Art Direction**: Detailed notes on the visual aesthetic for different regions and factions, from scorched landscapes in the Fire Court to ethereal ice environments in the Frost Court.
- **Planned Features**: Upcoming or potential features such as crafting systems, expanded dialogue mechanics, or multiplayer capabilities.

This section is crucial for tracking how the game design evolves during development.

## Code Documentation

The **Code Documentation** section provides an in-depth technical reference for the game's codebase. It covers:

- **Core System Architecture**: A breakdown of the main C++ classes, including the player controller, character classes, and ability system integration.
- **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**: How the Unreal Engine’s **Gameplay Ability System** is implemented to manage player abilities, attributes, and effects.
- **Important Code Snippets**: Critical code examples, including player movement, camera control, party management, and interaction mechanics.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Techniques used to ensure the game runs efficiently, from code-level optimizations to blueprint and asset management.

This section is essential for developers working on the project or anyone interested in the technical aspects of game development.

## Engine Workflows

The **Engine Workflows** section provides detailed guides on using **Unreal Engine 5** to build the game. This section includes:

- **Level Design Workflow**: Techniques for designing and populating levels, including the use of **World Partition** for large, dynamic environments.
- **Asset Management**: Best practices for managing large assets, optimizing game performance, and maintaining scalability across the game world.
- **Blueprint Integration**: How blueprints are used alongside C++ code to prototype and rapidly implement gameplay features.
- **Automation and Tools**: Custom tools and workflows to speed up development, including automation pipelines for asset generation and testing.

This section is a go-to resource for understanding how Unreal Engine 5 is leveraged to create the game's world and systems.
